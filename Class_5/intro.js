// A simple JavaScript file to demonstrate basic concepts.

// --- Topic: JavaScript Introduction and Setup ---

// 1. What is JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
// It runs inside the browser's JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).

// 2. Adding JavaScript to HTML
// You can link this file to an HTML page using the <script> tag:
// <script src="introduction.js"></script>

// 3. Browser Developer Tools and Console
// To open the developer tools in most browsers, you can press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect."
// The "Console" tab is where you can see messages and debug your code.

// Use console.log() to print messages to the console.
console.log("Hello, world! This message is from introduction.js");
console.log("This is how we can debug and see what our code is doing.");

// 4. JavaScript Syntax and Case Sensitivity
// JavaScript is case-sensitive. 'myVariable' is different from 'MyVariable'.
let myVariable = 10;
let MyVariable = 20;

console.log(myVariable); // This will output 10
console.log(MyVariable); // This will output 20

const hello_world = "Hello World";
const mainText = "Good Morning";

console.log(hello_world);
console.log(mainText);


// 5. Comments
// Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.
// This is a single-line comment.

/*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   You can write on multiple lines here.
   It's useful for explaining more complex code blocks.
*/

console.log("Comments help other developers (and you!) understand your code.");
