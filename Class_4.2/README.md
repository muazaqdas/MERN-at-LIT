Will share the boilerplate HTML code with students using online clipboard.

And code the html structure first. With main, section, img, a, tags
    strong, p, h#, sup (superscript)

Then move to CSS style sheet, where I'll code basic styling
Then flex styling

And if time permits, grid styling as well.
